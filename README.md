Important Note: Form Submission

This editor is a pure front-end application. The submission form (<form action="/submit-article" method="post">) is configured to send data to a backend.

For it to actually work and save articles, you will need to implement a server-side API (e.g., with Node.js, Python, PHP, etc...) that will receive and process this data. The path http://127.0.0.1:5500/submit-article is an example target URL for such a backend.

For a quick preview of the generated HTML, use the "HTML Preview" function available in the editor's toolbar.
